# Supported foreign languages

The Nit language currently supports 3 foreign languages: C, C++ and Java. 

|                    | [[C|FFI/FFI_with_C]] | C++  | [[Java|FFI/FFI_with_Java]] |
|-------------------:|:---:|:----:|:----:|
| Extern method      | x   | x    | x    |
| Callback to method | x   | x    | x    |
| Callback to super  | x   | x    |      |
| Casts, etc.        | x   | x    |      |
| Static types       | x   | x    |      |

Table 1: Supported features in each FFI


[[!traillink "FFI with C"]] describes the interface between Nit and C. Which allows to implement Nit methods directly in C code, and more.

There's also a guide to develop Nit [[!traillink "wrapping C libraries" text="wrappers for existing C libraries"]] to access their features through normal Nit modules.

[[!traillink "FFI with Java"]] describes the interface with Java.

[[!traillink "Nit on Android"]] gives some guide lines on how to develop for Android in Nit.
