# # Debugger

The Nit standard debugger is a tool based on the Interpreter for Nit, it supports basics commands used for debugging a program much like GDB or such.

For now, the debugger is a standalone binary file, to use it, launch your program using the nit interpreter *nit* and use the *-d* option. (Later to be included in the Eclipse plugin)

# # Commands

n : Proceeds to the next instruction (step-over)

s : Steps in an instruction

finish : Steps out of an instruction

b/break line_number : Adds a breakpoint on line *line_number* for the current file

b/break file line_number : Adds a breakpoint on line *line_number* for the file *file*
