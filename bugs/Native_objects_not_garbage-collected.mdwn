Each time an intern or extern object is allocated, the native representation is left as it (memory leak) when the Nit part of the object is garbage collected.

Example:

    for i in [0..10000000[ do
        var s = i.to_s
    end
    stdin.read_line # pause and look at the mem footprint (with top for instance)
