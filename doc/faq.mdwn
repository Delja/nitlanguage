### How to iterate on collection/array/list/maps/etc.

The `for in` construction is used to iterate on many structures.

Common usages are arrays:

    for x in [1, 2, 3] do print x*2
    # outputs 2 4 6

ranges:

    for x in [1..3] do print x*2
    # outputs 2 4 6

and maps:

    var mymap = new HashMap[String, Int]
    mymap["one"] = 1
    mymap["two"] = 2
    mymap["three"] = 3
    for k, v in mymap do print "{k}={v}"
    # outputs "one=1 two=2 three=3"

But the `for in` structure can be used on all colletions and all classes that provide an `iterate` method.
