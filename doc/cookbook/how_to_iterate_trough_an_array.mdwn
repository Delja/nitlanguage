# How to iterate trough an array

The simplest way to iterate trough an `Array` (or any `Collection`) is to use the `for` control structure.

    var a = [1, 2, 3]
    for i in a do
        print i * 2
    end
    # print 2 4 6

If the index is needed, a alternative is to iterate on the ragne of the indexes.

    var a = ["a", "b", "c"]
    for i in [0..a.length[ do
        print "{i}:{a[i]}"
    end
    # print 0:a 1:b 2:c
