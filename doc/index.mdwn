# [[ |info24.png]] What is Nit?

Nit is an object-oriented programming language. The goal of Nit is to propose a robust statically typed programming language where structure is not a pain.

So, what does the famous hello world program look like, in Nit?

    print "Hello, World!"
 
# [[ |features24.png]] Feature Highlights

## Usability
Nit's goal is to be usable by real programmers for real projects

* [[KISS|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle]] principle
* Script-like language without verbosity nor cryptic statements
* Painless static types: static typing should help programmers
* Efficient development, efficient execution, efficient evolution.

## Robustness

Nit will helps you to write bug-free programms

* Strong static typing
* No more NullPointerException

## Object-Oriented

Nit's guideline is to follow the most powerful OO principles

* Everything is an object
* Multiple inheritance
* Open classes
* Virtual types

# [[ |run24.png]] Getting Started

Get Nit from its Git repository:

    $ git clone http://nitlanguage.org/nit.git

Build the compiler (may be long):

    $ cd nit
    $ make

Compile a program:

    $ bin/nitc examples/hello_world.nit

Execute the program:

    $ ./hello_world
