# Nit for Sublime-Text

[Sublime-Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) is a lightweight editor with a good support for most programming languages.

As of now, the bundle for supporting Nit in Sublime-Text only supports syntax highlighting.

## How to install

To install the support for Nit in Sublime-Text, you can just copy the syntax highlighter property list file (available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/R4PaSs/Sublime-Nit/master/Nit.tmLanguage), and copy it in your Packages folder (~/.config/sublime-text-version/Packages/).

When you are done with this step, you can enjoy Nit source highlighting on any .nit source file automatically !

Alternatively, when supported, you'll be able to install the support for Nit via [Package-Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/) !
