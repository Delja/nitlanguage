# Download and install

## Download

Nit is still in heavy development.

The main way to get to get it from its [[git repository|http://nitlanguage.org/nit.git]]

    $ git clone http://nitlanguage.org/nit.git

or to download the latest [[snapshot|http://nitlanguage.org/nit.git/snapshot/HEAD.tar.gz]] (tar.gz)

A [[github mirror|http://github.com/privat/nit]] is also available.

## Build

In the `nit` directory, just call `make`

## Install

Currently, there is no official installation process, the tools and lib should just works in place.

It it sill a good idea to have the binaries in your `PATH`

~~~sh
$ echo 'export PATH=/absolute/path-to-nit/bin:$PATH' >> .profile
~~~

Also install `bash_completion` for the tools.

~~~sh 
$ echo 'source /absolute/path-to-nit/misc/bash_completion/nit' >> ~/.bash_completion
$ source ~/.bash_completion
~~~
