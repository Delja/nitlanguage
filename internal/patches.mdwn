# Sending Code Contributions

Here the rules fon contributing

Use the coding style described in [[the manual|manual/syntax]].

Describe your patches in english with a one-liner summary, a blank line, then an explanation of the problem and the advantages of the solution implemented by the patch.

Sign-off all your patches by including the line "`signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>`" at the end of each patch description. By the signed-off-by tag, you state that you agree with the [[contribution policy]].

Keep patches as clean as possible: have only one concern by patch, do not include unrelated changes in a patch, patch series is not about *how* you developed your solution but about the best way to present your changes.

Check the checklist (belllow) before sending something.

You can communicate patches by the way you prefer including: merge request on some Git repository by email, merge request to the [[nit githup repository|https://github.com/privat/nit]], or patches by email.

For some generic information about contributing to a project that uses Git, [[ProGit|http://git-scm.com/book/ch5-2.html]] has a dedicated section.

## Check list

* Each patch have a proper description

      $ git rebase --whitespaces=fix my_base my_branch

* Check the style with [[nitpretty|tools/nitpretty]]

* Check warnings with [[nitpick -W|tools/nitpick]]
