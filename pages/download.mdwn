# Download and install

## Download

Nit is still in heavy development.

The main way to get to get it from its [[git repository|http://nitlanguage.org/nit.git]]

~~~sh
$ git clone http://nitlanguage.org/nit.git
~~~sh

or to download the latest [[snapshot|http://nitlanguage.org/nit.git/snapshot/HEAD.tar.gz]] (tar.gz)

A [[github mirror|http://github.com/nitlang/nit]] is also available.

## Build

In the `nit` directory, just call `make`

## Install

Currently, there is no official installation process, the tools and lib should just works in place.

It it sill a good idea to have the binaries in your `PATH`

Add the following in your `.profile` file.

~~~sh
export PATH=/absolute/path-to-nit/bin:$PATH
export MANPATH=/absolute/path-to-nit/share/man:$MANPATH
~~~

Also install `bash_completion` for the tools.

Add the following in your `.bash_completion` file (or create it if it does not exist).

~~~sh 
source /absolute/path-to-nit/misc/bash_completion/nit
~~~
