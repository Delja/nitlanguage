# The Nit Language Reference

This document attempts to be as short as possible while covering all
features of the language in depth. It is not a real manual to learn the
language since concepts are covered only when required.

Warning: The manual is not up to date with the current language implementation and features.
See [Issue #761](https://github.com/privat/nit/issues/761)
