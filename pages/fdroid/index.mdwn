# Repository of Android Applications

Android users can use the <http://fdroid.org> client, add the official Nit-Droid repository and benefit bleeding-edge state of the art of mobile Nit applications.

0. Download and install the [F-Droid client](https://f-droid.org/FDroid.apk)
1. Manage repository (in the menu)
2. Add a repository (plus icon)
3. Enter the address <http://nitlanguage.org/fdroid>
4. Update (update icon)

Note: A new F-Droid category `Nit` contains all the applications.

The source code of the applications in the F-Droid repository is available in the [`examples`](http://nitlanguage.org/nit.git/tree/HEAD:/examples) and [`contrib`](http://nitlanguage.org/nit.git/tree/HEAD:/contrib) directories.

These applications are compiled by the Nit tools thanks to the [[mnit support|FFI/Nit_on_Android]]

Note: if, for some reason, the fdroid client is not functional, there is the raw [list of downloadable `.apk` files](list.html).
