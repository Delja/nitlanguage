# # What is Nit?

Nit is an object-oriented programming language. The goal of Nit is to propose a robust statically typed programming language where structure is not a pain.

So, what does the famous hello world program look like, in Nit?

~~~
print "Hello, World!"
~~~

# # Feature Highlights

## Usability
Nit's goal is to be usable by real programmers for real projects

* [[KISS|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle]] principle
* Script-like language without verbosity nor cryptic statements
* Painless static types: static typing should help programmers
* Efficient development, efficient execution, efficient evolution.

## Robustness

Nit will help you to write bug-free programs

* Strong static typing
* No more NullPointerException

## Object-Oriented

Nit's guideline is to follow the most powerful OO principles

* [[Everything is an object]]
* [[Multiple inheritance]]
* [[Open classes|refinement]]
* [[Virtual types]]

# # Getting Started

Get Nit from its Git repository:

~~~sh
$ git clone http://nitlanguage.org/nit.git
~~~

Ensure that dependencies (and recommendations) are installed:

~~~sh
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential ccache libgc-dev graphviz libunwind7-dev
~~~

Build the compiler (may be long):

~~~sh
$ cd nit
$ make
~~~

Compile a program:

~~~sh
$ bin/nitc examples/hello_world.nit
~~~

Execute the program:

~~~sh
$ ./hello_world
~~~

And now?

* Install plugins for your [[editor or IDE|ide]] to works with Nit
* Read the language [[manual]]
* Browse the bundled [[libraries|http://nitlanguage.org/doc/stdlib]]
