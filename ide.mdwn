# Support for common IDE

Supports (plugins/bundle/etc.) for IDE are developed by volunteers.

Currently, there is 4 supported externals tools (not necessary IDE)

* [[eclipse]]
* [[vim]]
* gtksourceview (used by gedit, Anjuta and several other projects)
* gnu source-highlight

For the last ones, see the [[misc/|http://nitlanguage.org/nit.git/tree/master:/misc/]] directory of the archive for installation directives.
